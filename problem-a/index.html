  <p><a href="https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Gandalf">Gandalf the Grey</a> is a fictional 
    character from the world of Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, books written by J.R.R Tolkien. 
    In the stories, Gandalf is a wizard or istari who helps the main characters defeat Sauron.</p>

    <p>I admire Gandalf for the following reasons: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>He is selfless in his deeds, helping the hobbits while putting himself at risk</li>
        <li>He is the only of the five istari who remained uncorrupted</li>
        <li class="yellow">He is able to find time to relax: launching fireworks and smoking his pipe</li>
      </ul>
